## Introduction
We implement several machine learning algorithms as follows:

1. [KNN](./neighbours/)
2. [Decision Tree](./decision_tree/)
3. [Linear models for regression](./linear_model_for_regression/)
4. [Linear models for classification](./linear_model_for_classification/)
5. [Naive Bayes](./Naive%20Bayes/)
6. [Probability distribution](./prob_distribution/)
7. [Mixture models](./mixture_model/)
8. [Gaussian Process](./gaussian_process/)
9. [DNN for classification and regression](./DNN/)
