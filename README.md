## Introduction
We implement several machine learning algorithms as follows:

1. [KNN](./knn/)
2. [Linear models for regression](./linear_model_for_regression/)
3. [Linear models for classification](./linear_model_for_classification/)
4. [Naive Bayes](./Naive%20Bayes/)
5. [Probability distribution](./psrob_distribution/)
6. [Mixture models](./mixture_model/)
7. [DNN for classification and regression](./DNN/)
## Get Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/H-Joker/sunrise-machine-learning-2022.git
cd sunrise-machine-learning-2022
conda create -n ml python=3.9.0
conda activate ml
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
